### Added
- Comprehensive test suite with 33+ unit tests covering:
  - CLI argument parsing
  - Internationalization (i18n)
  - UI output functions
  - Command runner
  - Individual tool update logic
- Module structure:
  - `cli`: Command-line argument definitions and parsing
  - `i18n`: Localization and language detection
  - `ui`: User interface output, color handling, progress bars
  - `progress`: Progress state and progress bar management
  - `runner`: External command execution wrapper
  - `commands`: Update logic for various tools (Homebrew, Rustup, Mise)
  - `utils`: Common utility functions

### Fixed
- String escaping issues in localization module
- Clap version flag conflicts

### Internal
- Improved error handling across all modules
- Better separation of concerns
- Enhanced code documentation
- Prepared foundation for future parallel execution support

## [0.3.5] - Previous Release

## Upgrade Notes

### 0.3.5 â†’ 0.4.0

This is a refactoring release that maintains full backward compatibility. All existing commands and options work exactly as before. The main changes are internal code organization improvements that will enable:

- Easier addition of new package managers
- Better testing and maintenance
- Future parallel execution support
- Improved error handling and reporting

No action is required from users upgrading from 0.3.5 to 0.4.0.
