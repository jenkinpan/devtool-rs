## Coding Guidelines

### Style Guide

- Follow the official [Rust Style Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/)
- Run `cargo fmt` before committing
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functions
- Add integration tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Aim for good test coverage

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run specific test
cargo test test_name
```

### Documentation

- Add doc comments (`///`) for public functions and types
- Include examples in doc comments when helpful
- Update README.md if adding new features
- Update CHANGELOG.md following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format

### Commit Messages

Follow these guidelines for commit messages:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests when applicable

Examples:
```
Add support for npm package manager

- Implement npm detection
- Add update command for npm
- Add tests for npm functionality

Fixes #123
```

## Adding Support for a New Package Manager

To add support for a new package manager:

1. Create a new module in `src/commands/` (e.g., `npm.rs`)
2. Implement the detection and update logic
3. Add the module to `src/commands/mod.rs`
4. Add tests for the new functionality
5. Update documentation (README.md, CHANGELOG.md)
6. Update the help text if needed

Example structure:
```rust
use crate::runner::Runner;
use anyhow::Result;

pub fn is_installed() -> bool {
    // Check if the tool is installed
}

pub fn update(runner: &dyn Runner, dry_run: bool) -> Result<()> {
    // Implement update logic
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[test]
    fn test_is_installed() {
        // Your test here
    }
}
```

## Running CI Locally

Before pushing, ensure all CI checks will pass:

```bash
# Format check
cargo fmt --check

# Lint check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

# Run tests
cargo test --verbose

# Build release
cargo build --release

# Check documentation
cargo doc --no-deps --all-features
```

## Release Process

Releases are managed by maintainers. The process is:

1. Update version in `Cargo.toml`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with release notes
3. Commit changes: `git commit -am "Release v0.x.0"`
4. Create and push tag: `git tag v0.x.0 && git push origin v0.x.0`
5. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Build binaries for multiple platforms
   - Create a GitHub Release
   - Publish to crates.io

## Getting Help

- Start a discussion for questions or ideas
- Check existing issues and discussions first
